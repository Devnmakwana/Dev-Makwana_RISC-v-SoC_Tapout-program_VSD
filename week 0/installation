🛠️ Tools Installed
1️⃣ Verilog (Icarus Verilog)

Installed successfully on Ubuntu.

Verified installation by compiling and simulating a simple Verilog program.



2️⃣ Yosys (Logic Synthesis Tool)

Installed open-source synthesis tool Yosys.

Confirmed installation by checking the version and opening the tool.



3️⃣ GTKWave (Waveform Viewer)

Installed GTKWave to visualize simulation waveforms.

Verified installation by opening the GTKWave GUI.



✅ Week 0 Summary

Completed environment setup on Ubuntu 20.04.

Installed 3 essential tools: Verilog (Icarus Verilog), Yosys, and GTKWave.

Verified that each tool works properly.

📌 This sets the foundation for RTL design and simulation tasks starting in Week 1.
