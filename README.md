# 🖥️ RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program — VSD

### 🇮🇳 RISC-V VSD Participants India

Welcome to my journey through the **SoC Tapeout Program VSD** 🚀

This repository documents my **week-by-week progress** with tasks and learnings.

> *"In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India's largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon and advance the nation's semiconductor ecosystem."*
